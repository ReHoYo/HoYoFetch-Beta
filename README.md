### Notes

1️⃣ **Game Coverage:**  
Currently supports Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, and Zenless Zone Zero.  
_Tears of Themis and Honkai Impact 3 are not supported due to API limitations._

2️⃣ **Server Compatibility:**  
The bot only works for Global servers (Asia, America, EU, and HW/TW/MO servers).  
⚠ Mainland China servers (Irminsul, Celestia) are not supported.

3️⃣ **Code Update Timing:**  
The bot uses the Hoyocode API, so there may be a short delay before new codes appear depending on when the API updates.

4️⃣ **Funny Reward Messages:**  
Sometimes you may see messages like:  
> “We asked Paimon and she replied that it's probably primogems.”  
This simply means the API found a code but didn't provide reward details. The code is still valid and redeemable.

5️⃣ **Downtime / Support:**  
If the bot goes offline, please contact `suichanwaa`. The VPS probably pooped itself
